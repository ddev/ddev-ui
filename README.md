# ddev-ui
A repo to use as a starting point for ddev UI prototypes, research, and roadmaps.

## Instructions
* Ensure DDEV is installed and properly working via CLI and you have valid projects installed.
* Download and install Node.js (http://www.nodejs.org)
* CD into root directory of this project
* in a terminal, run `npm install`
* after your node dependencies have been installed, run `node index.js`

## Initial Roadmap

Sidenote: eventually this should live here https://github.com/drud/ddev-ui/wiki/Roadmap.

### v0.0: Research, Prototypes, Requirements, and Roadmaps

The intention of this milestone is to brainstorm a larger answerspace (research and prototypes) to then help shape our initial, long-term target (requirements and roadmaps). This will touch on many different themes, including but not limited to the following:

* Design
* License Compatibility
* Technology Selection
* Repository Structure w/DDEV CLI
* Feature list and roughed out requirements
* Roadmap
* API requirements
* DDEV CLI development needs to support the API
* Interface with hosting dashboard/offering
* Testing Infra / Strategy
* OS compatibility and requirements

At the end of this process, we should have the following deliverables:

* Roadmap with a proposed path of high level milestones to a 1.0 release.
* First three initial milestones defined out with description and key features.
* GitHub issues filed with full acceptance criteria against milestones v0.1, v0.2, and v0.3.
* Technology and testing selection.
* CLI API requirements and prioritization.
* Key UIs identified and mocked out / prototyped
